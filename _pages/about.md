👋 I am a prospective PhD student working on efficient and reliable deep learning systems.  
My research focuses on making large-scale AI models more memory-efficient, deployable, and practical for real-world systems.

🔎 **My current interests include:**
- Model compression (quantization & sparsity)
- Memory-efficient inference for large language models (LLMs)
- KV-cache optimization for long-context decoding
- Hardware-aware algorithm design (FPGA / ASIC accelerators)
- Efficient dataflow and PIM architectures

## 🎯 Research Vision

Modern AI models are becoming increasingly large and computationally demanding.  
I am interested in bridging the gap between algorithm design and hardware constraints — designing methods that are not only theoretically sound, but also efficient in memory, latency, and energy.

My long-term goal is to build scalable AI systems that are both intelligent and efficient.
